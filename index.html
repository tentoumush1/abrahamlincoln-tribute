                Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, in a log cabin in
                Kentucky. Raised in poverty, he had little formal education and
                was mostly self-taught. In 1816, his family moved to Indiana,
                where he developed a strong work ethic while reading and
                learning independently.

                After moving to Illinois in 1830, Lincoln worked as a store
                clerk before entering politics. In 1834, he was elected to the
                Illinois House of Representatives, serving four terms. He later
                became a lawyer and, in 1846, was elected to the U.S. Congress
                for a single term.
